# rescue-the-block

This is a classic game where you need to move the block through the narrow space to reach the destination block. 
You can have a look and play it here https://ctran.itch.io/rescue-the-block.

It is a simple game to show the object move around in 3D environment. 
From the project, I learned how to control, rotate the object everywhere I want. 
I learned how to use assets to change terrain and add objects on terrain. I also learn to do a simple lightmap to optimize performance.
